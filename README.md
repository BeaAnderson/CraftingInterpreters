# CraftingInterpreters
Implementation of book Crafting interpreters written by Robert Nystrom

Followed for the purpose of my professional development

To run this project you should compile it using javac *.java from the lox package

From the root directory then run java -classpath . com.fdmgroup.lox.Lox

if you pass in a file location you can run lox code from a file, otherwise you can execute lines individually.

See https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html for documentation on the language and https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters for the source material.
